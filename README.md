#Convective Core Wifi Location Sensing Monitor

This is the repo for the monitor component of the Convective Core Wifi Location Sensing application. Monitors measure wifi signal strength from wifi clients and send this information to the Convective Core Wifi Location Sensing server. The server uses signal strength information from three monitors and performs trilateration [Trilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration) to determine the location of wifi clients in range.
